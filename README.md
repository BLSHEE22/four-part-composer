Prerequisites:
- Python3
- LilyPond (http://lilypond.org/download.html)
- Notation software that can open MIDI files (MuseScore for example)

Setup Instructions:
- Open terminal.
- Clone this repository onto your computer.
- Navigate to the repository in your terminal (cd four-part-composer).

Generating Music:
- Run the script of your choice by entering the command 'python3 _filename_'.
- This will create a '.ly' file in that same repository.
- Open the '.ly' file using LilyPond.
- Press cmd-R to convert the LilyPond file to MIDI. You should then see a similarly named MIDI file '.midi' appear in the repository. If a PDF is made instead, you will need to add "\midi{}" to the .ly file directly after the second-to-last closed curly brace. Save and redo the cmd-R, and you should now see that the MIDI file has been generated within the repository.
- Open the '.midi' with your notation software of choice.
- Play back the score.
- Want to generate another tune/melody? Simply repeat the 'Generating Music' steps!

Enjoy!
