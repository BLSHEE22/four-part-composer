# four-part-composer

ACEâ„¢ (Algorithmic Composition Engine).

Current supported features:
- 'makeFourParts.py' -> Writes a 16-bar, four-part harmonized tune.
- 'melody.py' -> Generates a melody (AABA, 16 measure default) from either a major, minor, chromatic, or randomly built scale.

'melody.py' TODO: 
- Implement sixteenth notes.
- Implement 'target note' feature to create countour and punctuate phrases.
- Add 'rhythmic motif' feature that writes and employs rhythmic motifs.
- Implement smarter rests that punctuate phrases and are not just random.
- Create more random variables to control dynamics, articulations, ornaments, tempo, and meter.
- Implement the ability to use pickup notes.
- Expand choice of forms (need more variety than AABA).
- Create more user parameter support to decide form, phrase length, and tune length.
- Add features to support serialism, talea and color, etc.

- This will create a 'ConvertMe.ly' file in that same repository.
- Open 'ConvertMe.ly' using LilyPond.
- Press cmd-R to convert the LilyPond file to MIDI. You should then see the MIDI file 'ConvertMe.midi' appear in the repository.
- Open 'ConvertMe.midi' with your notation software of choice.
- Playback the score.
