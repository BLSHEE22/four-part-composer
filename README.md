# four-part-composer

ACEâ„¢ (Algorithmic Composition Engine).

Current features:
- 'makeFourParts.py' -> Writes a 16-bar, four-part harmonized tune.
- 'melody.py' -> Generates a 16-bar melody from either a major, minor, chromatic, or randomly built scale.

Features in development: 
- Support for sixteenth notes.
- Random variables to control appoggiaturas, dynamics, articulations, tempo, and meter.
- 'Rhythmic Motif' feature that writes and develops rhythmic motifs.
- Expanded choice of forms (need more variety than AABA).
- 'counter.py' -> Writes a counter-melody to a given melody.
- 'harmony.py -> Combines the power of 'counter.py' and the original harmonization logic to create natural sounding four-part harmonies.
